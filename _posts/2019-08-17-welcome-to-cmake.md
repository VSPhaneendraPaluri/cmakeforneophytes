# Getting Familiar with CMake

Welcome to my Wiki on CMake.  In this blog, I'd like to share information on how to get started with CMake.

This Wiki page might be helpful to the newbies who have got bored of maintaining build scripts to build their
projects, and want to learn about more powerful tools that does this better.

This content listed within the template projects don't present details on the *basics of CMake*.
I've tried to present few introductory slides [here](/slide-deck/learn-cmake.pptx).

For readers who are already aware of CMake, and want to learn or just brush-up some basics related to CMake,
one may start from [here](/home).

Hope you enjoy learning CMake !  :)
