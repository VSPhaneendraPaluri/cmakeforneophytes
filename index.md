## Brief Intro ...

Welcome to my Wiki on CMake.  In this site, I'd like to share information on how to get started with CMake Build System Generator.


## Target Group

This Wiki page might be helpful to the newbies who have got bored of maintaining build scripts to build their projects, and want to learn about more powerful tools that does this better.  Also, might be interesting for the Cpp enthusiasts.  Most of the sources within this repository are related to Cpp stuff !

This content listed within the template projects don't present details on the *basics of CMake*.  I've tried to present few introductory slides here in [[.pptx]({{ site.repository-path }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/blob/{{ site.branch }}/slide-deck/learn-cmake.pptx?raw=true)/[.pdf]({{ site.repository-path }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/blob/{{ site.branch }}/slide-deck/learn-cmake.pdf?raw=true)] formats.  Then, the reader is recommended to start with the [Start-Here Page]({{site.baseurl}}/home/home).

For readers who are already aware of CMake, and want to learn or just brush-up some basics related to CMake, one may start with the [Demo-Examples]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2019-08-20-demo-examples %}).
